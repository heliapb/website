# Release v0.51.0

We are excited to announce the release of Perses v0.51.0!

This release brings several new features, improvements, and bug fixes to enhance your experience with Perses.

It is a significant step forward in the evolution of Perses, and we are thrilled to share it with you. We have
been working hard to bring you a more powerful and flexible platform for your observability needs.

This release includes a new plugin architecture that allows you to develop external plugins and load them in Perses, as
well as several new plugins, including a datasource variable and a histogram chart.

Also, as part of this change we are introducing a new repository `perses/plugins` containing all default plugins
supported by Perses.

We have also made significant improvements to the documentation, highlighting features that were implemented some time
ago but not well advertised, such as datasource discovery and ephemeral dashboards.

## New Plugins system

## Custom Lint rules

As you may know, to validate your dashboard, we have implemented a set of rules.
These rules are executed when you save your dashboard during the unmarshalling step from JSON or YAML or during the
validation of each plugin using Cuelang.

In this release, we have added the ability to create custom lint rules. This allows you to enforce specific standards or
practices within your organization.

These custom rules should be defined in the configuration file of your Perses instance, typically located at
`/etc/perses/config.yaml`. The rules are defined under the `dashboard.custom_lint_rules` section.

Here is an example of how to define custom lint rules for dashboards:

```yaml
dashboard:
  custom_lint_rules:
    - name: "Dashboard Naming Convention"
      target: "$.metadata.name"
      assertion: "value.matches('^[a-z]+(-[a-z]+)*$')"
      message: "Dashboard name must be all lowercase letters with hyphens only."
      disable: false

    - name: "At Least One Panel Exists"
      target: "$.spec.panels"
      assertion: "value.size() > 0"
      message: "Dashboard must contain at least one panel."
      disable: false
```

We are using the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax to target specific parts of the dashboard
JSON structure, and the assertion is a [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) expression.

To know more about the syntax of the rules, please refer to
the [documentation](https://perses.dev/perses/docs/configuration/custom-lint-rules)

## Disable datasource and variable

In Perses, it is possible to create datasource and variables at three different levels: global, project, and dashboard.

Usually for security and governance reasons, you may want to prevent people to create datasource and variables at
various levels. For global and project levels, this is already possible using the RBAC system.

But before this release, it was not possible to disable the creation of datasource and variables at the dashboard level.

In this release, we are introducing the ability to disable the manipulation of datasources and variables at any level.
For that, you need to modify the configuration file of your Perses instance, and add the following section:

```yaml
datasource:
  global:
    disable: true
  project:
    disable: true
  disable_local: true
```

This configuration is preventing the usage of datasources at any level and disable the associated HTTP route in the
Perses proxy.

Of course, this config is silly because without datasources, you cannot use dashboards, but it is a good example of how
to disable datasources.

Same example applies for variables:

```yaml
variable:
  global:
    disable: true
  project:
    disable: true
  disable_local: true
```
