# Release v0.51.0

We are excited to announce the release of Perses v0.51.0!

This release brings several new features, improvements, and bug fixes to enhance your experience with Perses.

It is a significant step forward in the evolution of Perses, and we are thrilled to share it with you. We have
been working hard to bring you a more powerful and flexible platform for your observability needs.

This release includes a new plugin architecture that allows you to develop external plugins and load them in Perses, as
well as several new plugins, including a datasource variable and a histogram chart.

Also, as part of this change we are introducing a new repository `perses/plugins` containing all default plugins
supported by Perses.

We have also made significant improvements to the documentation, highlighting features that were implemented some time
ago but not well advertised, such as datasource discovery and ephemeral dashboards.

## New Plugins system

### Datasource variable

### Histogram Chart

## Custom Lint rules

As you may know, to validate your dashboard, we have implemented a set of rules.
These rules are executed when you save your dashboard during the unmarshalling step from JSON or YAML or during the
validation of each plugin using Cuelang.

In this release, we have added the ability to create custom lint rules. This allows you to enforce specific standards or
practices within your organization.

These custom rules should be defined in the configuration file of your Perses instance, typically located at
`/etc/perses/config.yaml`. The rules are defined under the `dashboard.custom_lint_rules` section.

Here is an example of how to define custom lint rules for dashboards:

```yaml
dashboard:
  custom_lint_rules:
    - name: "Dashboard Naming Convention"
      target: "$.metadata.name"
      assertion: "value.matches('^[a-z]+(-[a-z]+)*$')"
      message: "Dashboard name must be all lowercase letters with hyphens only."
      disable: false

    - name: "At Least One Panel Exists"
      target: "$.spec.panels"
      assertion: "value.size() > 0"
      message: "Dashboard must contain at least one panel."
      disable: false
```

We are using the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax to target specific parts of the dashboard
JSON structure, and the assertion is a [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) expression.

To know more about the syntax of the rules, please refer to
the [documentation](https://perses.dev/perses/docs/configuration/custom-lint-rules)
